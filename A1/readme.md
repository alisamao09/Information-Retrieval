### Goals of the assignment:
1. Practice computing probabilities and understanding conditional probabilities relationships to priors
2. Understand how design choices like tokenizing and stopword filtering influence which tokens appear in an index
3. Understand how to use SpaCy to do simple text operations like tokenizing
4. Gain awareness of the performance costs of different implementations of the same operation through an analysis on tokenization.
5. Become familiar with the vector space model and one way of converting text into vectors using (sklearn) Understand how IR systems are evaluated with MAP and DCG and what impact ranking position has on models quality.
6. Gain new software development and debugging skills
7. Improve the ability to read software library documentation
