In order to build a recommendation system for jokes to benefit non-native speakers in a work setting and to entertain joke lovers, we implemented 3 different recommenders including collaborative filtering (baseline), mean rating recommendation (naive approach), and AE (advanced system), and compared their results. We found that the baseline model works the best with the highest NDCG and hit rate, whereas the AE works the worst. The baseline model may be used to preliminarily recommend some jokes. Possible future work includes switching to a bigger dataset with fewer null values and parameter tuning such as changing the batch size or number of epochs or changing layer architectures to improve the performance of AE. And if we can get datasets with timestamps, we could try VAE and other advanced deep learning methods as well.
